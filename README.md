# Welcome to Acme TODOtech!
## Overview
For this challenge, pretend that today is your first day of work at a (fictitious) company named Acme TODOtech. 

This company makes money by offering "TODO lists as a service" to its customers.

## The Challenge
The product team has approached you with their shiny new front-end application written in Angular 7, which you can find here: https://github.com/JamesAtPropertyMe/AcmeTodoList

They have asked you to implement the back-end services that stores the TODO lists in the database, so any users accessing the TODO lists service can see the same 
list, considering this application could be used in high traffic and in a cluster environment.

### The expected outcome/output
- A working demo application and its 'Production' source code. If it requires setting up an environment to run the source code, a manual for setting up the environment should also be included.

### Technical constraints / What we're looking for
- The code should be clean and self-explanatory and following coding best practices.
- The Web API should be RESTful.
- The choice of database is not limited to certain type but such choice should be made with justification.
- Containerization is not mandatory but it will be a plus if you use it in your project.
- Your code must be in a local git repository, with a README.md file documenting how to set up the environment.
- We want to see your commit history, and we also want to see how you arrived at your solution.
- When you have completed your solution, send the source code (along with the git repository) to us in a zip file.

## Other things to remember
- Please do not publish your source code on Github or any other public repository. Publishing your code to a public website on your first day
will result in a security breach for the company, which is probably not a good idea ;)
